    "#Python Blackjack\n",
    "#For this project you will make a Blackjack game using Python.  \n",
    "#If you are not familiar with the the rules of the game,  \n",
    "#check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack. \n",
    "#You won't be implementing every rule \"down to the letter\" with the game, \n",
    "#but rather doing a simpler version of the game. \n",
    "#This assignment will be given to further test your knowledge on object-oriented programming concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Rules:\n",
    "#1. The game will have two players: the Dealer and the Player. \n",
    "    #The game will start off with a deck of 52 cards. \n",
    "    #The 52 cards will consist of 4 different suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. For each suit,\n",
    "    #there will be cards numbered 1 through 13. \n",
    "    #(Note that this is a departure from the way a real deck works - \n",
    "    #numbered cards 1-13 will be easier to implement. \n",
    "    #Feel free to try to implement a normal deck of cards if you would prefer!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Note: No wildcards will be used in the program\n",
    "#2. When the game begins, the dealer will shuffle the deck of cards, \n",
    "    #making them randomized. After the dealer shuffles, \n",
    "    #it will deal the player 2 cards and will deal itself 2 cards from. \n",
    "    #The Player should be able to see both of their own cards, but should only be able to see one of the Dealer's cards.\n",
    "#3. The objective of the game is for the Player to count their cards after they're dealt. \n",
    "    #If they're not satisfied with the number, they have the ability to 'Hit'. \n",
    "    #A hit allows the dealer to deal the Player one additional card. \n",
    "    #The Player can hit as many times as they'd like as long as they don't 'Bust'. \n",
    "    #A bust is when the Player is dealt cards that total more than 21.\n",
    "#4. If the dealer deals the Player cards equal to 21 on the first deal, the Player wins. \n",
    "    #This is referred to as Blackjack. Blackjack is NOT the same as getting cards that equal up to 21 after the first deal. \n",
    "    #Blackjack can only be attained on the first deal.\n",
    "#5. The Player will never see the Dealer's hand until the Player chooses to 'stand'. \n",
    "    #A Stand is when the player tells the dealer to not deal it anymore cards. \n",
    "    #Once the player chooses to Stand, the Player and the Dealer will compare their hands. \n",
    "    #Whoever has the higher number wins. Keep in mind that the Dealer can also bust.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#This will be an exercise of how well you understand OOP(Object Oriented Programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
